# A simple to-do web application

This project is something simple a web page that you can upload and see what tasks you need to do, in order to organize your time better.

## What did I use for it

React & Bootstrap, and I used the BEM methodology to write CSS looking for a first-mobile design to do it responsive.

### It's not finished yet, i'm looking to how i can store data in JSON with React, or something similar
